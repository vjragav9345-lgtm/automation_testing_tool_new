"""AutoFlow QA dashboard - Flask app tying the frontend to the Playwright
automation engine.

Recording is no longer a separate UI step. Clicking Launch Browser opens
the user-supplied URL and immediately starts the Recorder on it; the
terminal becomes the recording control - actions print live as they
happen, and pressing ENTER in the terminal stops and saves the session.

That whole lifecycle (launch, record, wait for ENTER, stop, save) runs on
one dedicated background thread per session, not on Flask's request
thread. Two reasons:
  - Playwright's sync API is tied to the OS thread that created it, so
    whatever thread launches the browser has to be the one used for the
    rest of that session's calls.
  - Waiting for a terminal ENTER can take an arbitrary amount of time,
    and Flask needs to stay responsive (status checks, QA replay runs)
    while that's happening.
Everything else (QA replay, product validation, report) is unaffected by
this - /api/test/run already runs the generated script (which also does
product validation, if requested) as its own subprocess, so it never
touches this thread's Playwright objects.
