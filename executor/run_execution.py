"""Runs a generated Playwright script (see generator/script_generator.py)
against a QA URL as a separate process, then layers content/screenshot/
UI-element/product validation on top of the structured result it writes out.

This used to have its own in-process copy of the click/fill/select replay
logic, separate from what the generated script did. That meant "the script
you can inspect" and "what actually runs" could drift apart, which is
exactly what generated-script users don't want. Now there's exactly one
replay implementation - the generated script - and this module just runs
it and interprets the result.

Product validation runs INSIDE that same script/subprocess too, on the same
page the recorded workflow just produced - not a separate session. This
module only passes the requested product name through as a CLI arg and
reads back whatever the script already found; it never opens the site a
second time.
