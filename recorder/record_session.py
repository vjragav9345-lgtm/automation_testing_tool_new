We don't spawn a second browser for recording - it rides on the same
page the user launched from the dashboard. The injected JS always
forwards click/change/submit/keydown events to Python; whether they
actually get kept is gated by self.recording here, not by any flag in
page JS. That matters because page JS resets on every navigation - if
the on/off switch lived there, a "stopped" recorder could start
capturing again the moment the user navigates (add_init_script re-runs
the capture script on every new page load). Keeping the switch on the
Python side avoids that.

Navigation itself isn't something page JS can reliably report (the page
is usually about to unload), so that's watched from the Python side via
Playwright's framenavigated event instead.
