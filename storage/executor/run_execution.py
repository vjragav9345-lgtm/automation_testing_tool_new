"""Runs a generated Playwright script (see generator/script_generator.py)
against a QA URL as a separate process, then layers content/screenshot/
UI-element/product validation on top of the structured result it writes out.

This used to have its own in-process copy of the click/fill/select replay
logic, separate from what the generated script did. That meant "the script
you can inspect" and "what actually runs" could drift apart, which is
exactly what generated-script users don't want. Now there's exactly one
replay implementation - the generated script - and this module just runs
it and interprets the result.

Product validation runs INSIDE that same script/subprocess too, on the same
page the recorded workflow just produced - not a separate session. This
module only passes the requested product name through as a CLI arg and
reads back whatever the script already found; it never opens the site a
second time.

# invented:
#   - BASELINE_OVERHEAD_SEC mirrors the exact "page load timeout + 10s
#     buffer" pattern app.py's own recording-launch readiness wait
#     already uses (PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT/1000 + 10) - the same real-world
#     cost this replay subprocess pays once, up front, for the browser
#     to launch and its first page to load.
#   - SECONDS_PER_STEP matches generator/script_generator.py's own
#     page.goto(..., timeout=30000) - the single slowest per-operation
#     timeout already used anywhere in the generated script, i.e. the
#     worst-case cost a single recorded step (a navigation) can
#     legitimately take. Most steps (a click, a fill) finish in a
#     fraction of this; it's a ceiling per step, not an expected
#     average, so real runs finish well under the total budget.
BASELINE_OVERHEAD_SEC = 40
SECONDS_PER_STEP = 30

# of blocking forever. 30 minutes comfortably covers a session of ~55
# actions even if EVERY single one hit the worst-case per-step cost
# above (55 * 30s + 40s overhead ~= 1750s) - realistically far more
# steps than that finish inside this window, since most steps cost a
