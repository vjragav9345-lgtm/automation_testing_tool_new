"""Configurable-age cleanup for the directories this project accumulates
files in over time: recordings, generated scripts, replay run folders
(screenshots + reports), the top-level launch-screenshot folder, and the
shared reports/ fallback.

Deliberately NOT a background scheduler (no cron/APScheduler) - this
project explicitly doesn't want that kind of always-on infra. Cleanup
runs only when something calls run_cleanup() (see app.py's
/api/maintenance/cleanup route), with dry_run=True as the safe default
so a human reviews what WOULD be removed before anything actually is.

Safety rules, all enforced here rather than left to the caller:
  - age-based only, using each item's own mtime against RETENTION_DAYS -
    nothing younger than the configured window is ever touched, and
    there's no other basis (name, "looks unused", ...) for removing
    something
  - an item currently in use is skipped regardless of age: a recording
    with an active recording session in progress, or ANY file under a
    run folder that a currently in-flight replay (see executor/
    run_execution.py's own _active_replays registry) is still writing to
  - every candidate path is verified to actually resolve inside one of
    the configured target directories before any removal - never
    touches anything else, even if a bug elsewhere fed this a bad path
  - a missing/already-gone file is logged and skipped, never an error
    that aborts the rest of the sweep
  - archive mode (the default) moves matched items under retention_archive/
    instead of deleting them outright, so "cleanup" is recoverable by
    default; delete mode removes them for good. Both are logged per item.
